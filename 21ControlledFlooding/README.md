Create a communication topology from this adjacency matrix:

Then implement controlled flooding algorithm with sequence number.
The actor A will start the algorithm with sequence number 0 (it means: the first "flooding")
If an actor receives a message with a sequence number, it stores it (for the first "flooding" it will always be 0).
If the sequence number is already stored, it drops the message.
Be careful that the sequence number should be the same for all actors. Here 0, for example.

You then have to flood a second and a third time, with a flooding sequence number equals to 1 and 2: actor A will therefore start with sequence number 1 and 2.
