for this "mini-project" pattern, you will implement leader election pattern. 


You will find the descritpion of one of the first  leader election algorithm in the book "Distributed Algorithms for Message-Passing Systems" written by Michel Raynal, page 79 section 4.2 A Simple O(n²) Leader Election Algorithm for Unidirectional Rings.

This algorithm was first discovered by E. Chang and R. Roberts in 1979 see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang_and_Roberts_algorithm 

you can also read the 2 pages original paper :

Ernest Chang and Rosemary Roberts. 1979. An improved algorithm for decentralized extrema-finding in circular configurations of processes. Commun. ACM 22, 5 (May 1979), 281–283. https://doi.org/10.1145/359104.359108

Please write a little report (max 2 pages) that show how you test your algorhtm and the results you have.
