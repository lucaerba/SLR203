Here are the priorities for the SLR203 patterns:

6: top priotiry V

7: low

8: very low

9: very low

10: top priority V 

11: medium

12: low

13: medium

14: very low

15: low

16: very low

17: very low

18: medium

19: top priority V

20: top priority V

21: top priority V

22: top priority V

23: the "mini-project" pattern ! be careful, this one is very long and complex ! It is top priority ! 

do the top priority first, then the medium and if you have time (but it might be boring) the others, but it's more interesting to do the 23 as soon as possible !

Notes: for the pattern 10, the scheduler "call" should be usually in the constructor of one actor

tarting pattern 10: when actors need references to other actors at the beginning, send the references by message preferably, even if those messages don't appear in the visual representation of the pattern (for the sake of simplicity)

24: boh
